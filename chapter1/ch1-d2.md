#### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety & Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming.

#### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Cadence's 5 pillars are useful, for someone who doesn't have much knowledge regarding blockchain/coding for many reasons. Firstly, the safety and security pillar allows for new/inexperienced developers to focus on learning and properly build out their smart contracts, without having to worry about the possibility of there being security exploits within their contract. Due to the approachabilitly and clarity pillars of Cadence, if someone didn't have much coding experience, they'd be able to read and comprehend the language easily; along with learning the language with ease. Finally, because of the developer experience pillar, inexperienced developers can detect and resolve any errors within their code; thanks to Cadence's clear and concise error messages.
