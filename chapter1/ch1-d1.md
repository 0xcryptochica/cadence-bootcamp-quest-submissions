#### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp
The blockchain is a decentralized database that stores information, that is publically available for anyone to store information. Meaning that not only can anyone can view the stored data, but there's also no central authority. The information on the blockchain is collected and stored within blocks, and once full chain to other previously filled blocks; forming a chain, or blockchain.

#### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts
Smart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain, that when written, determine whether a user is allowed or not allowed to perform something on the blockchain. These "rules," are similar to predetermined conditions a user must follow. Once a smart contract is complete and deployed to the blockchain, the smart contract will then execute the actions written inside of the contract.

#### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
Scripts are used to view data, such as stored transactions on the blockchain. However, scripts are not used to change data. Since scripts are simply used to view data on the blockchain, they do not cost money; unlike transactions.

Transactions are the opposite of scripts, and change the data on the blockchain. Unlike scripts, transactions cost money to execute. Transactions are usually the only way to alter data stored on the blockchain as well.
